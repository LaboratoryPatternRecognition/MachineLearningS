    "**ML** Machine learning is an artificial intelligence technique that enables systems to learn from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memorization and learning are two contrasting concepts. If you have a strong memory, you don't need to find the rules or roots of the data; you can easily memorize the data. When a request is made, you can provide the closest concepts from what you've memorized. In machine learning, *lazy learning* refers to this approach. One of the principles of machine learning is generalization, which contrasts with memorization. Therefore, limited memory acts as a constraint on the system, making it necessary to apply mathematical methods, principles, or appropriate structures to achieve generalizable learning.\n",
    "The use of sparsification serves this purpose by reducing memory usage, and it is commonly employed as a regularization term to enhance generalization.\n",
