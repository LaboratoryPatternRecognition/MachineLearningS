    "   - **Objective**: Identify which source domain instances are most similar to those in the target domain to reduce model variance and bias. When the target domain dataset is limited, integrating source domain data can help mitigate high variance. Nonetheless, substantial differences between the domains might introduce bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Utilizing Selected Instances:**\n",
    "   - **Objective**: Incorporate the selected source domain instances into learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of the target domain model.\n",

    "**Mathematical Formulation:**\n",

The problem is when the marginal distributions differ but the conditional probabilities are the same. For example, different hospitals (domains) have different patient populations (marginal distributions), but the disease causes (conditional probabilities) are the same.\n",
