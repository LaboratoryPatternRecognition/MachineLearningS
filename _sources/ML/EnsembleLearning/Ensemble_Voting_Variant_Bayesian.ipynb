    "Voting is a fundamental approach for combining multiple classifiers, where each learner contributes to the final decision. This method is known as an ensemble, and the combination process often involves averaging the outputs of individual classifiers. In its simplest form, voting gives equal weight to each classifier. However, other combination rules can be applied to achieve more sophisticated results. These rules are particularly important when the outputs are not posterior probabilities, as they require normalization to ensure consistent scaling across different classifiers.\n",

    "##  Ordered Weighted Averaging Combiners\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) is a generalized model from the nontrainable group was introduced by Yager in 1988. It uses a set of $ L $ coefficients, one for each classifier in the ensemble. OWA does not assign a specific coefficient to a classifier directly. Instead, the classifier outputs for $ \\omega_j $ (the $ j $-th column of $ \\text{DP}(x) $) are first arranged in descending order. A weighted sum is then calculated using the coefficients associated with the positions in this ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $ \\mathbf{w} = [w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_L]^T $ be a vector of coefficients such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum_{k=1}^{L} w_k = 1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "0 \\leq w_k \\leq 1 \\quad \\text{for } k = 1, \\dots, L\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The support for $ \\omega_j $ is calculated as the dot product of $ \\mathbf{w} $ and the vector $ [d_{i_1, j}(x), d_{i_2, j}(x), \\dots, d_{i_L, j}(x)]^T $, where $ i_1, \\dots, i_L $ is a permutation of the indices $ 1, \\dots, L $ such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "d_{i_1, j}(x) \\geq d_{i_2, j}(x) \\geq \\dots \\geq d_{i_L, j}(x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the support for $ \\omega_j $ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "m_j(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^{L} w_k \\cdot d_{i_k, j}(x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By selecting the coefficients $ \\mathbf{w} $, a variety of operations can be modeled. Specific operations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Minimum**: $ \\mathbf{w} = [0, 0, \\ldots, 0, 1]^T $\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Maximum**: $ \\mathbf{w} = [1, 0, 0, \\ldots, 0, 0]^T $\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Average**: $ \\mathbf{w} = \\left[\\frac{1}{L}, \\frac{1}{L}, \\ldots, \\frac{1}{L}\\right]^T $\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Competition Jury (Trimmed Mean)**: $ \\mathbf{b} = [0, \\frac{1}{L-2}, \\ldots, \\frac{1}{L-2}, 0]^T $\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $ F $ be an Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) operator with a weighting vector $ \\mathbf{w} $. The orness of $ F $, denoted as $ \\text{orness}(\\mathbf{w}) $, is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{orness}(\\mathbf{w}) = \\frac{1}{L} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (i - 1) \\cdot w_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ \\mathbf{w} = [w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_L] $ is the weighting vector, and $ n $ is the number of weights. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can observe the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The orness of $ \\mathbf{w} $ always lies within the unit interval $[0, 1]$.\n",
    "- The closer $ \\mathbf{w} $ is to an \"or\" function, the closer the orness is to 1.\n",
    "- The closer $ \\mathbf{w} $ is to an \"and\" function, the closer the orness is to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically:\n",
    "- For $ \\mathbf{w} = [1, 0, \\ldots, 0]^T $ (representing \"or\"), we get $ \\text{orness}(\\mathbf{w}) = 1 $.\n",
    "- For $ \\mathbf{w} = [0, \\ldots, 0, 1]^T $ (representing \"and\"), we get $ \\text{orness}(\\mathbf{w}) = 0 $.\n",
    "- For $ \\mathbf{w} = \\left[\\frac{1}{L}, \\frac{1}{L}, \\ldots, \\frac{1}{L}\\right]^T $ (representing the arithmetic mean), we get $ \\text{orness}(\\mathbf{w}) = 0.5 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "The orness is 1 for only the max function (\"or\") and 0 for only the min function (\"and\"). However, orness can also be 0.5 in cases other than the arithmetic mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the weighting vector $ \\mathbf{w} $ is non-decreasing (i.e., $ w_i \\leq w_{i+1} $ for $ i = 1, \\ldots, L-1 $), then $ \\text{orness}(\\mathbf{w}) \\geq 0.5 $. Conversely, if the weighting vector is non-increasing (i.e., $ w_i \\geq w_{i+1} $ for $ i = 1, \\ldots, L-1 $), then $ \\text{orness}(\\mathbf{w}) \\leq 0.5 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of OWA\n",
    "\n",
    "For two OWA functions with weighting vectors $ \\mathbf{w}_1 $ and $ \\mathbf{w}_2 $ and orness values $ o_1 $ and $ o_2 $, if:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{w}_3 = \\alpha \\mathbf{w}_1 + (1 - \\alpha) \\mathbf{w}_2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ \\alpha $ is a scalar, then the orness $ o_3 $ of $ \\mathbf{w}_3 $ is a weighted average of $ o_1 $ and $ o_2 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $ \\alpha \\in [0, 1] $, then for an OWA function with weighting vector $ \\mathbf{w}_3 $, the orness value is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{orness}(\\mathbf{w}_3) = \\alpha \\, o_1 + (1 - \\alpha) \\, o_2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ o_1 $ and $ o_2 $ are the orness values of the weighting vectors $ \\mathbf{w}_1 $ and $ \\mathbf{w}_2 $, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine a weighting vector with a desired orness value, different combinations of $ \\mathbf{w}_1 $ and $ \\mathbf{w}_2 $ can be used. These combinations will result in different $ \\mathbf{w}_3 $ vectors, all having the same orness value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The andness can be defined as the complement of orness:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{andness}(\\mathbf{w}) = 1 - \\text{orness}(\\mathbf{w})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, an OWA operator with most of its nonzero weights near the top of the vector will exhibit \"or-like\" behavior, with $\\text{orness}(\\mathbf{w}) \\approx 1$. Conversely, an OWA operator with most of its nonzero weights near the bottom will exhibit \"and-like\" behavior, with $\\text{andness}(\\mathbf{w}) \\approx 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, if we have two weighting vectors, $\\mathbf{w}_1$ and $\\mathbf{w}_2$, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{w}_1 = [a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{w}_2 = [a_1, \\ldots, a_j, e, \\ldots, e, a_{k+1}, \\ldots, a_n]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $e$ being nonzero, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{orness}(\\mathbf{w}_2) \\geq \\text{orness}(\\mathbf{w}_1)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** An important class of weighting vectors that generate $\\text{orness}(\\mathbf{w}) = 0.5$ are symmetric weighting vectors. This value of 0.5 does not necessarily mean that preference is given to central scores. For example, the vector $\\mathbf{w} = [0.5, 0, 0, \\ldots, 0, 0.5]$ can be used to balance preferences between extremes. \n",
    "\n",
    "### [Entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory))\n",
    "Another important measurement is dispersion, which reflects how uniformly the weights are distributed and can be seen as a measure of entropy. It is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 3**  \n",
    "Let $ \\mathbf{w} = [w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_n] $ be a weighting vector. The measurement of the dispersion of $ \\mathbf{w} $ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{disp}(\\mathbf{w}) = -\\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \\ln(w_i)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ w_i $ are the weights and $ \\ln $ denotes the natural logarithm.\n"
